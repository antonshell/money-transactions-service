# Software engineer test assignment - Paxful 

You need to implement a backend application that would allow users to transfer funds
between wallets. On every transaction, the system will need to take a commission of
1.5%.

# Requirements

- Create a relational database schema

- Upon application start, the database should be populated with sample data (e.g
several wallets that can be used to transfer funds between)

- The system should support two currency: BTC and ETH

- Create a REST endpoint that can be used to transfer funds

- Provide a docker-compose.yml that can be used to run your solution by just
doing â€‹docker-compose up
